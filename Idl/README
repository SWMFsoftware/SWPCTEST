# EXAMPLES OF USE

# calculate POD, POF, HSS for dB/dt > 0.3nT/s threshold 
# for all available models, for the high latitude stations, for event 2 only 

IDL> predict,'dbdt',stations=['abk','pbq','ykc'],threshold=0.3,firstevent=2,lastevent=2
Observed total dbdt: pod, pof, hss=  1.0000  0.0000  1.0000
Observed total db  : pod, pof, hss=  0.8704  0.0556  0.8049
SWMFccmc total dbdt: pod, pof, hss=  0.1667  0.0432  0.1613
SWMFccmc total db  : pod, pof, hss=  0.4815  0.0556  0.4825
SWMForig total dbdt: pod, pof, hss=  0.1667  0.0370  0.1707
SWMForig total db  : pod, pof, hss=  0.4630  0.0432  0.4857

# The dbdt rows show results when dB/dt is obtained from finite differencing.
# The db   rows show results when dB/dt is approximated with a power law of dB.
#
# This will also generate 3 plots: 1 for the observations and 2 for the two models:
dbdt_Observed.eps 
dbdt_SWMFccmc.eps   
dbdt_SWMForig.eps

# The plots show the time variation of the observed (black) 
# directly predicted (green) and power law predicted (red) dB/dt 
# for each station. There is useful information ABOVE each plot, 
# but it seems to be chopped off (it is visible with gv on an A4 size page).

# The plots don't work when multiple events are analyzed (should generate
# a multipage EPS output).

# OTHER EXAMPLES:

# generating dbdt_SWMFccmc_abk_dt20_0.7threshold.eps for a single station
# last event etc.
# the exponent=0 switch is off the power law fitting
predict,'dbdt',stations=['abk'],threshold=0.7,firstevent=5,imodel=1,exponent=0

# generating db_SWMFccmc_abk_dt20_150threshold.eps
predict,'db',stations=['abk'],threshold=150,firstevent=5,imodel=2,exponent=0
