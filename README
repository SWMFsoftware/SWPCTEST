This repository contains scripts and data for validating the 
Michigan Geospace model based on the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF).

The deltaB directory contains observations and SWMF model results 
of the magnetic disturbances at 12 magnetometer stations 
for the six SWPC challenge events that were run by CCMC. 
See deltaB/README for more detail.

The Idl directory contains scripts to evaluate the results and calculate
skill scores both for direct dB/dt and power law fit a(dB)^p. 
See Idl/README for more detail.
