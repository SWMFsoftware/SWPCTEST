This repository contains scripts and data for validating the 
Michigan Geospace model based on the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF).

The SWPCTEST directory must be placed within an installed SWMF source code
directory and have access to SWMF's Makefile.def file.

The deltaB directory contains observations and SWMF model results 
of the magnetic disturbances at 12 magnetometer stations 
for the six SWPC challenge events that were run by CCMC. 
See deltaB/README for more detail. 
See A. Pulkkinen et al. 2013, Space Weather, 11, 369, doi:10.1002/swe.20056

Event specific information, such as start and stop times, are contained in
"event_list.txt".  Files common to each simulation can be found in the Inputs
directory.  Event-specific input files, such as solar wind inputs and
satellite trajectory files, are found in the Inputs/event[#] directories.
Additional events can be added by adding new entries to event_list.txt and
creating a corresponding Inputs/event[#] directory.

DSCOVR data can be obtained from https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dscovr/  (POP, M1M, F1M)
ACE data can be obtained from https://izw1.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/
(ACE_Mag_data    16s: year, dy, hr, mn, sc, Bgse_x,y,z),
(ACE_PLASMA_data 64s: year, dy,  hr, mn, sc, H+ dens, temp, velGSEx,y,z, GSE_x,y,z)


The Idl directory contains scripts to evaluate the results and calculate
skill scores both for direct dB/dt and power law fit a(dB)^p. 
See Idl/README for more detail.
See G. Toth et al. 2014, J. Geophys. Res., 119, 310, doi:10.1002/2013JA019456

REQUIREMENTS:
SWPCTEST is designed to run on NASA's Pleiades machines.  The following
system modules must be loaded via "module load <package>" syntax:
python/2.7.6 (or newer)
idl/8.1 (or newer)

USAGE:
To execute the test, install the SWMF in the usual manner.  Then, enter the
SWPCTEST directory and type 

make help

to see the available options. To run the code for all 6 events type

make test

To run a subset of events, type

make test EVENTS=2,3,5

This will configure and compile the SWMF, create separate run directories and
copy input files for each event, and submit the simulations to the run queue.
Note that as of now, the suite is set up to execute on the NASA Pleiades super
computer.  At this point, the user must wait for the simulations to finish.
Upon completion, the user should return to the SWPCTEST directory and type 

make check  

This will then collect the simulation results into the deltaB/Results directory
for each event.  Metrics are then calculated and saved.  In each results
directory (deltaB/Results/Event*), a text file is generated with probability of
detection (POD), probability of false detection (POF), and Heidke Skill Score
(HSS) for high and mid latitude magnetometer groups for a variety of dB/dt
thresholds.  These same numbers are calculated for the results obtained for the
SWPC selection study led by CCMC.  This allows for a comparison of the current
version of the code with the version originally submitted to SWPC.  A summary
table that contains the metrics for all events and stations together is written
to the results directory.  Finally, the results and metrics are archived in
compressed tar file.
